# NASprojectEvilHangman
The project for native app studio. The project is to make the game Evil Hangman


I still have to describe the full project in the readme and I have to write de design document. 
In This version the basic gameplay is created. For now there is only a single word. The player can guess letters and reports messages of correct or wrong guesses. The remaining guesses are written down, the part of the word guessed so far and the guessed letters. 


I have to make a game ending. I didn't use any designs in this version. I have to order the code into different classes, create settings to change types of game and add highscore lists.
